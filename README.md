# Node.js Starter Overview

The Node.js Starter demonstrates a simple, reusable Node.js web application based on the Express framework.

## Run the app locally

1. [Install Node.js][]
2. Download and extract the code from github
3. cd into the app directory
4. Run `npm install` to install the app's dependencies
5. Run `npm start` to start the app (it'll tell you what port is assigned)
6. Access the running app in a browser at http://localhost:6012 (or whatever node tells you)
7. Login using the details defined in the users.js file (or the db if you extended it to be more secure)
user1: mb1 / str4ng3r
user2: tp1 / m4g1c14n

(pst! try the different accounts)

Keep an eye on the running node app to see the console.log output
If you also want to be nosy, view the Console in the web browser too...
